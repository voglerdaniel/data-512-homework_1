# Homework 1

The goal of this project is to collect, process, and analyze a set of data about pageviews for ~1700 English Wikipedia articles related to rare diseases.

The code in this repository is made available under the MIT license. 

The datasets used in this project were generated by making requests to the [Wikimedia REST API](https://doc.wikimedia.org/generated-data-platform/aqs/analytics-api/reference/page-views.html) under the organizations [Terms of Use](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Terms_of_Use). The ToU bind this project to certain rules and norms, including the ["API Etiquette"](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Etiquette) provisions requiring that requests to the API be made sequentially, not in parallel, to preserve site stability.

The Wikimedia REST API is documented [here.](https://doc.wikimedia.org/generated-data-platform/aqs/analytics-api/reference/page-views.html).

After reading this `README.md`, viewers should refer to the `building_article_views_datasets.ipynb` notebook in the `code` folder at the top level of this repo. For best results, [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) then open that notebook in a viewer like Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.

`building_article_views_datasets.ipynb` creates three `.json` outputs in the output folder:
- [Rare disease pageviews from desktop](output/rare-disease_monthly_desktop_201507-202409.json)
- [Rare disease pageviews from mobile](output/rare-disease_monthly_mobile_201507-202409.json)
- [Cumulative rare disease pageviews](output/rare-disease_monthly_cumulative_201507-202409.json)

It also generates four intermediate `.json` data files representing various stages on the way to generating the outputs described above. Those can be found in the `intermediate` folder; `building_article_views_datasets.ipynb` explains their purpose.

After understanding how the dataset was created, viewers should reference `code/rare_diseases_analysis.ipynb`.
